<p>This is my first school. I went to school at Dato' Maharaja Lela School from the age of 7 to 12 years old. This school is very close to my house.
It only takes 5 minutes if riding a vehicle such as a motorcycle or car.This school is big, because almost all the residents of the 3 villages who send 
their children to study in this school. Each grade has 7 to 8 classes. This primary school is the same as other primary schools which has 2 sessions. 
Students in grades 4, 5 and 6 attend the morning session, while students in grades 1, 2 and 3 attend the afternoon session.</p>

<p>Primary school is the best. Childhood, there is no need to think about adult things. No need to think about money, about bills, about anything.
 That is a child, i only knows how to play. At that time, i was not mature yet i was naughty.For your information, I am an excellent student, you know. 
1st grade time, I was randomly admitted to 1st grade. Greetings. 5th ranked class at the school. After I sat for a compulsory test, I was admitted to class 1 Adnin,
 class number 2. I was in class Adnin until grade 5. After working hard, I managed to get into class number 1 in grade 6 which is class Firdaus.And finally, 
I was also one of those who managed to make my school famous, by getting 5 A's in the UPSR results. I am so happy and proud of myself.</p>

<p> Jeram Secondary Religious School is a school that has many memories for me. That's also where I know the meaning of love. Love has become a common thing, especially 
teenagers will definitely not get away with love.</p>
<p> Every day I go to school by bus. I have to get out of the house waiting for the bus at 6:30 am and will arrive exactly at 6:50 am at school. 
Memories of riding the bus crowded with the students I will never forget. my grief of studying at SAMJ is also the most beautiful memory. 
If I could turn back time, I would stay in high school. But I know it's impossible. Life has to go on because time is always running out.</p>

<p>I am a student enrolling in 2019. I took a diploma in library management for 2 years here. Soon, in August 2021, I will be finishing my diploma.
I really enjoy studying here, even though Kedah is far from Selangor but I am thankful, God gave me new friends who are very good to me.
The lecturers here are also all kind and understand if the students have problems.My course only takes 2 years. Most courses take 2 and a half years. 
I was lucky because I was able to finish my diploma faster.</p>
